# 2022-Layoff-Predictor

## Description
This ML model aims to predict the number of layoffs that may occur within a company by analyzing various factors, including location, industry type, date of layoff, funding stage, and total funds raised.

The model was developed using a comprehensive dataset comprising 2,257 tech companies that experienced layoffs from COVID 2019 to 2024. This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides valuable insights into layoff trends and factors influencing workforce reductions.
