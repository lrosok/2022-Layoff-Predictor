# 2022-Layoff-Predictor

## Description
This ML model aims to predict the number of layoffs that may occur within a company by analyzing various factors, including location, industry type, date of layoff, funding stage, and total funds raised.

The model was developed using a comprehensive dataset comprising 2,257 tech companies that experienced layoffs from COVID 2019 to 2024. This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides valuable insights into layoff trends and factors influencing workforce reductions.

You can access the dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swaptr/layoffs-2022
